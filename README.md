Due to Xinhua's close proximity to city center and relatively low living cost and attracts young creative working class to settle in and become the "new locals".

The project mapped the lifestyles of the "new locals" according to preferable Point of Interest (Baidu POI), cycling routes (MoBike data), living concentration (demographic & house price data) to identify community reusable space and space structure.

By creating shareable community hubs, better cluster linkages, and an online neighborhood platform, residents, administrators, and public sectors can work together to improve the neighborhood.
